  .row

      %p When the group is ready to make a decision, you can raise a proposal by clicking the <strong>"Create a proposal"</strong> button on the right-hand side of the discussion page.

  .row
    .col-sm-6
      %p When you create a new proposal you will be required to provide a <strong>title</strong>, a <strong>closing date</strong> and any relevant <strong>details</strong>. It’s a good idea to use a short title indicating a clear course of action so that people immediately know exactly what it means to agree or disagree. The <strong>“Details”</strong> field can be used to provide any background information that ensures everyone has the context required to make an informed decision.
      %p Keep in mind that it’s not the end of the world if a proposal doesn’t get clear agreement immediately. If the group doesn’t love the first proposal, a new proposal can be started to address the concerns raised, and keep the process moving forward. The deadline on a proposal can also be extended at any time, if it looks like the decision needs some more space.
      %p Everyone will get an email notification 24 hours before a proposal closes.
      %h3.anchor#editing-proposals Editing a proposal
      %p Group coordinators and the proposal author can edit the proposal details until a group member states their position. However, the closing time for the proposal can be changed by a group coordinator or the proposal author at any time over the course of the proposal. A proposal can also be closed before its scheduled closing time if it does not meet the needs of the group.

  .row
    .col-sm-6
      %p When you’ve selected your position, you will be prompted to give a brief explanation as to why you feel this way.
      %p Underneath the pie graph, you can see what everyone else thinks. This makes it easy to catch up with the discussion. As new information comes to light, you can change your position at any time over the course of the proposal.

  .row

  %h3.anchor#setting-outcome Setting a proposal outcome
  .row
    .col-sm-6
      %p When a proposal ends, it will remain on the right-hand side of the discussion page, inside a panel called <strong>“Previous decisions”</strong>. The person who raised the proposal will be prompted via email to provide an outcome statement for the proposal. Proposal outcomes can only be set by the person who started the discussion or the group coordinators. An editable outcome statement field will become visible underneath the proposal title in the <strong>“Previous decisions”</strong> panel. Here you can summarise the outcome of the proposal. You could, for instance, note who is responsible for carrying out an agreed-upon action. Clicking <strong>“Publish outcome”</strong> will notify everyone in the group of the outcome.

  %h3.anchor#closing-proposals Closing a proposal
  .row
    .col-sm-6
      %p Only the group member who started the proposal and any group coordinators can close an active proposal. If you want to close a proposal early, click <strong>“Edit”</strong> on the right-hand side of the <strong>“Current decision”</strong> panel. At the bottom of the <strong>“Edit proposal”</strong> form there will be an option to close the proposal early. When a proposal is closed early it will remain on the right-hand side of the discussion page in a <strong>“Previous decisions”</strong> panel, but participants will no longer be able to submit their positions.

  .row
    .col-sm-6
      %p When a new proposal is started, any previous proposals will be reduced to a summary (showing proposal title, the decision pie and your position) in a <strong>“Previous decisions”</strong> panel beneath the <strong>“Current decision”</strong> panel.
