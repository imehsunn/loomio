  %p The <a href="https://www.loomio.org/explore">Explore page</a> shows you public groups active on Loomio. It is accessible throughout the Loomio app via the <strong>“Public groups”</strong> link in the footer. From the <a href="https://www.loomio.org/explore">Explore page</a> you can search for a group by name or keyword, or by category, and click on a group to see its public content. A group’s privacy settings determine how you can become a member.

  .row
    .col-sm-8
      %p Other groups are accessible <strong>by request only</strong>, meaning that coordinators are required to approve (or ignore) membership requests. When this is the case you will see an <strong>"Ask to join group"</strong> button on the page.
    .col-sm-4
      =image_tag "ask-to-join-group.png", class: "screenshot"
  %p Upon clicking the <strong>"Ask to join group"</strong> button you will be prompted to provide an introduction, after which your membership request is sent and the group coordinators notified.
  %p Some public groups allow new members <strong>by invitation only</strong>, in which case you will be able to see the group but there will be no button and no way to join from the group page.
  %h3.anchor#single-sign-on Single sign-on
  .row
    .col-sm-7
      %p Loomio allows sign-up with Facebook, Google or Persona. If you do not have a Loomio account you can sign up using any of these third-party services by clicking the corresponding button on the <a href="http://loomio.org/sign_in">Log in page</a>. If you are currently logged in to Google, Facebook or Persona, this existing account will be detected. Otherwise you will be prompted to sign in. When Loomio recognises your existing third-party account, you will be required to follow the prompts to create your Loomio account.
      %p You may also associate an existing Google, Facebook or Persona account with an existing Loomio account. Ensure you are logged out, visit the <a href="https://www.loomio.org/users/sign_in">Log in page</a> and select your preferred platform. Loomio will ask you if you want to create a new account with your existing account on your chosen platform, or link it to your existing Loomio account.
